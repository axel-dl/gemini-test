## Gemini LLM Evaluation for chatbot-sale-2025

### Objective

This document summarizes the research and evaluation of Google's Gemini LLM as a potential conversational backend for the chatbot-sale-2025 project. The assessment covers Gemini's performance against key requirements including latency, safety, intent accuracy, cost, and reliability.

### Scope

The evaluation included the following:

- Review of Gemini's API features, cost, availability, and integration options (Node/TypeScript).
- Benchmarking of typical latency, throughput, and cost per conversation.
- Evaluation of safety mechanisms and moderation capabilities compared to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
- Assessment of JSON schema/function-calling support and reliability of tool calls.
- Documentation of strengths, limitations, and suitability for fallback or primary model usage.
- Actionable recommendations for adoption or rejection.

### Deliverables

- Summary report: Gemini fit analysis for chatbot-sale-2025
- Comparison table: Gemini vs GPT-4o mini vs Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Recommendations: integration plan or reasons for exclusion

### Acceptance Criteria

- Comprehensive technical and cost analysis
- Documentation of safety and schema support
- Clear recommendation with rationale

### Testing Roadmap

1. **Unit Tests:**
  
  - Individual function/method testing for core Gemini integration components.
  - Mock Gemini API responses to simulate different scenarios (success, failure, rate limits).
  - Focus on validating data transformations, request construction, and response parsing.
2. **Integration Tests:**
  
  - End-to-end testing of Gemini integration with other chatbot components.
  - Verify correct message flow and data exchange between Gemini and other services.
  - Simulate concurrent user interactions to assess stability and performance under load.
3. **Safety and Moderation Tests:**
  
  - Evaluate Gemini's ability to handle potentially harmful or inappropriate user inputs.
  - Test the effectiveness of safety filters and moderation mechanisms.
  - Identify and address any potential vulnerabilities or biases in Gemini's responses.
4. **Performance Tests:**
  
  - Measure Gemini's latency, throughput, and resource consumption under various load conditions.
  - Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize Gemini integration for optimal performance.
  - Compare Gemini's performance against other LLMs (GPT-4o mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to determine the best fit for the chatbot-sale-2025 project.
5. **Functional Tests:**
  
  - Verify that Gemini can accurately understand user intents and provide appropriate responses in different conversation scenarios.
  - Test the reliability of JSON schema/function-calling support and tool calls.
  - Ensure that Gemini can handle complex conversations and provide accurate and helpful information to users.
