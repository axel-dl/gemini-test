## Gemini LLM Evaluation for chatbot-sale-2025

### Objective

This document summarizes the research and evaluation of Google's Gemini LLM as a potential conversational backend for the chatbot-sale-2025 project. The assessment covers Gemini's performance against key requirements including latency, safety, intent accuracy, cost, and reliability.

### Scope

The evaluation included the following:

- Review of Gemini's API features, cost, availability, and integration options (Node/TypeScript).
- Benchmarking of typical latency, throughput, and cost per conversation.
- Evaluation of safety mechanisms and moderation capabilities compared to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
- Assessment of JSON schema/function-calling support and reliability of tool calls.
- Documentation of strengths, limitations, and suitability for fallback or primary model usage.
- Actionable recommendations for adoption or rejection.

### Deliverables

- Summary report: Gemini fit analysis for chatbot-sale-2025
- Comparison table: Gemini vs GPT-4o mini vs Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Recommendations: integration plan or reasons for exclusion

### Acceptance Criteria

- Comprehensive technical and cost analysis
- Documentation of safety and schema support
- Clear recommendation with rationale

### Testing Roadmap

#### ✅ Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and methods for Gemini integration components.
- Mock Gemini API responses for success, failure, and rate limits.
- Validate data transformations, request construction, and response parsing.

#### ✅ Integration Tests
- Test end-to-end Gemini integration with other chatbot components.
- Verify correct message flow and data exchange between Gemini and other services.
- Simulate concurrent user interactions to assess stability and performance.

#### ✅ Safety & Moderation Tests
- Evaluate how Gemini handles potentially harmful or inappropriate user inputs.
- Test the effectiveness of safety filters and moderation mechanisms.
- Identify and address vulnerabilities or biases in responses.

#### ✅ Performance Tests
- Measure Gemini's latency, throughput, and resource usage under various loads.
- Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize integration.
- Compare Gemini's performance against GPT-4o mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

#### ✅ Functional Tests
- Ensure Gemini understands user intents and gives proper responses in varied scenarios.
- Test reliability of JSON schema/function-calling support and tool calls.
- Confirm Gemini can handle complex conversations and provide accurate information.
